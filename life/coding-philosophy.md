## where to declare the filename in code blocks

I am very willing to declare the filename after the coding type, since I have seen many cases in the most popular frameworks, like gatsby.

However, when I am using vscode, it's sad for me to find that it's tricky since few of plugins did this work.

Then later, I find a wonderful alternative method to help me realize this goal, i.e. not declare it in the `label` position, but as a comment in the top of body of the code block.

That's the wisdom!
