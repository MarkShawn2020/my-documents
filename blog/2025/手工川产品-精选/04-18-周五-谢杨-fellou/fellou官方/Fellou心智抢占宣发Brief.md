## Slogan

**Industry perception:** The world's first agentic browser

  

**End-consumer perception:**

- Beyond browsing, into action
    
- A browser that can work for you
    

## What do KoC and KoL need to do?

1. Please edit and repurpose the video materials we provide, and incorporate real-life usage scenarios from your daily life.
    
2. Avoid mentioning that this is a paid promotion — instead, present it as if you discovered a hidden gem and became a beta tester.
    
3. The video should be around 1 minute long.
    
4. Try to highlight how this browser stands out from existing browsers (Arc, Dia and Opera and Chrome) or even ChatGPT, Perplexity and Manus and Gimini 3.5. Explain why you personally need it.
    
5. Ideally, start the video with a strong hook to grab attention right away.
    
6. Make sure to visually show our website in the video and clearly tell viewers where they can find us.
    

## Highlight（Product feature）

### (A) Deep action - Research: Cross plateform, fast, parallelized, readable, allow private website visiting

- When users are conducting research, exploring new fields, or making decisions, they often have to browse through a multitude of webpages, consolidate scattered information, and ultimately draw conclusions. This process is extremely tedious, and people generally dislike organizing fragmented data – it’s a significant pain point.
    
- Currently, although platforms like Perplexity, OpenAI Deep Research, and Manus can perform deep research, they are limited to accessing only publicly available resources in the cloud. When you ask them for information on private platforms such as Twitter, Quora, or LinkedIn, they are unable to retrieve it.
    
- Fellou supports in-depth search that not only covers the search and browsing of public web content but also retrieves pages from websites requiring login, such as Quora, X, LinkedIn, and so on. It enables a more comprehensive content search and generates visual reports that can be shared with just one click.

### (B) Deep Action - Manipulation: cross-pages, hands-free, allow private website login

- Currently, many AI browsers—such as Opera One and Dia—only implement a very basic capability of combining AI with browsing. In other words, they simply add a chatbot to the browser without any ability to take action.
    
- In contrast, Fellou is able to directly accomplish tasks for users based on their requirements. Fellou can automatically plan tasks, invoke tools, and perform actions by coordinating across multiple web interfaces to achieve a variety of tasks within the browser—for example, shopping, booking a meeting, sending an email, or posting a tweet in conjunction with web content.
    

Here are some use cases:

1. Fellou can summarise product information in Product Hunt and place it in a document specified in the notion.

2. Posting on LinkedIn

5. Open Gmail and send an email

### (C) Automate tasks based on browser context

Fellou can automatically identify open web pages as context in a conversation, or compare and analyze @ multiple web pages, and drag and drop images into the conversation area to interact with Fellou on the original web page without copying and pasting.

### (D) Fellou can collaborate with you asynchronously

Fellou supports tab groups, while Fellou Agent is performing related tasks, you can switch tab groups at the bottom to continue your other work, and Fellou will give you prompts to help you finish your work efficiently.

## Comparison

1. 1. In terms of generating research reports, compared to **Manus**, which generates a plan and then executes it step by step sequentially, our solution of opening multiple virtual windows in parallel is much faster, generating an in-depth research report in less than 8 minutes on average, which is faster than **Manus**, which takes 20 minutes. And the quality is better, our reports are richly illustrated, full of content, and well-detailed. Manus often generates markdowns, which takes extra time to generate a website.
    
2. Fellou reports are richer and deeper than **OpenAI's Search** and **Claude's Search**, or **Perplexity's Deep Research**.
    
3. Fellou is free compared to **OpenAI's Deep Research** which costs $20 a month and has a limit.
    
4. Fellou is an Agentic Browser with the ability to act autonomously and deliver value end-to-end, compared to **Dia**, which is a smart browser with just a Chatbot integrated into the browser.
