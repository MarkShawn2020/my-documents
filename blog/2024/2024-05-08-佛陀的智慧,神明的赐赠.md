This article is for some wise friends I recently met.

谨以此文章送给我最近认识的一些智慧的朋友们。

**Astral Requiem**,山下直人

Hello everyone, this is my fifth entrepreneurship weekly diary. In the previous articles, I wrote a lot of relatively sad words, such as:

- 2415: Towards the North, To See Mark.
- 2416: Five Seconds of Body, Mind and Will.
- 2417: DON'T PANIC.
- 2418: Written in the Darkest Wilderness.

大家好，这是我的第五篇创业周记，在之前的文章中，写了很多相对比较伤感的文字，例如：

- [2415：一生奔向北方，却见南川](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2OTg5NDg3Mg==&mid=2247484745&idx=1&sn=48cedd02850c3810d2e2212a1b9841da&chksm=ce975afef9e0d3e8bf4f1baa59fe8203411e0477061cff31787ae3c2558e477f92255aec04b1&scene=21#wechat_redirect)

- [2418：写在至暗的旷野](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2OTg5NDg3Mg==&mid=2247484765&idx=1&sn=7c8f88f7c0384c92d15d78209707ba93&chksm=ce975aeaf9e0d3fc30561aff37f6d31c444dbcf165d201ad67f5b0068b7755c989097e5d71c4&scene=21#wechat_redirect)

But in fact, it's not very painful or itchy, since it's more like a person complaining from time to time, even though he has some weird titles, such as Founder of XX.

但其实都不是很痛不是很痒，更多地像是一个人时不时发的牢骚，尽管他有一些奇奇怪怪的title，例如xx创始人之类。

But I still feel it is necessary to write those things, because pain is a problem that a person needs to face for a long time in his life.

但写那些，依旧觉得很有必要，因为伤痛是一个人这一生持久需要面对的问题。

Recently, there is a rather popular video like this. It combines elements such as urban and rural areas, capital and labor, growth and confusion, and expresses its sincerity in the form of rap (@see "New Rap 2024").

最近，便有个这样的视频很火，它集合了城市与农村、资本与劳动、成长与迷茫等元素，用说唱的方式将其真诚（参考《新说唱2024》哽咽唱阿卡贝拉）地表达了出来。

Considering that my fans are more literate than me, I won’t make a disgraceful interpretation and just share it directly:

考虑到我的粉丝们都比我有文化，所以就不献丑解读了，直接搬运分享：

Of course, the emotional value brought by such sad art comes and goes quickly. After all, we (at least I am now) do not live next to a factory or in ruins, surrounded by the teenagers, young, middle-aged and old who have no hope of survival and development.

当然了，这样的伤感艺术所带来的情绪价值，来得快去得也快，毕竟我们（至少我现在）没有居住在工厂旁、废墟上，身边是看不到生存与发展希望的少年、年轻人、中年人和老人。

Skyscraper are not completely meaningless. They are at least a spiritual totem, indicating an upward force that pierces the sky and stops the tear ducts of countless workers (or vice versa).

高楼大厦并非全然无意义，它至少是一种精神图腾，示意着一种向上的力量，刺破云霄，止住无数打工人的泪腺（抑或相反）。

For a long time, I would regard myself as a walking Buddha who only cares about traveling and does not care about the opinions of others. Similar things include not following the world at all: dropping out of school, changing careers, working as a Buddhist, and starting a business blindly.

很长的时间内，我都会把自己看作只会踽踽而行的佛陀，只顾赶路，不顾他人的眼光。类似的事情例如完全不按世俗出牌：退学、跨行、佛系打工、无脑创业。

Forget about starting a business, I always choose the track that is the most difficult (knowledge), and at the same time risky (bot).

创业也就算了，还总是选一些最难赚钱的赛道（知识类），同时风险还高（bot）。

Maybe I do have a predestined relationship with the Buddha. Although I often had a basket of food, a gourd of water, and a cup of tea to sit for a day, I enjoyed this in a way that outsiders would not understand.

但许是确是与佛有缘，虽时常一箪食一瓢饮，一杯茶水坐一天，此中乐，不足外人道也。

I roughly consider it as the wisdom of the Buddha (it should be at the same level as the wisdom of the Fool mentioned in the previous article), because both the Buddha and the Fool can probably do "A big belly can tolerate things that are difficult to tolerate, laugh at the people that are ridiculous to laugh.”

我把它粗浅地理解为佛陀的智慧（与上一篇提及的傻子的智慧应属同一层级），因为佛陀和傻子大抵都能做到「大肚能容容天下难容之事，开口便笑笑世间可笑之人」。

Under the guidance of such Buddha's wisdom, I have indeed met many good, noble, and important people in my life. Together, they have shaped my background and character, and guided my trajectory and direction.

在这样一种佛陀的智慧的牵引下，我这一生确实遇到了很多好人、贵人、重要的人，它们共同塑造了我的底色、品格，指引了我的轨迹与方向。

Some of these people are extremely powerful linkers. They have varying degrees of distorted positions and are good at matching the right resources to the right people, such as the sharp and courageous Chun Yu, the golden partner Xiaogang & Miss Flower, the calm and rational Patrick, the life coach Miss Jing, etc. (Unfortunately: they are all from the top2). This is an unexpected but reasonable result: those graduateing from the most elite colleges can continuously iterate the flywheel of confidence on the basis of self-consistency at the bottom. When you meet them, they may no longer flaunt their self-confidence from their background, since those have been part of them. (Contrast this with...)

这些人里，有一部分属于能量极强的链接者，他们拥有不同程度的扭曲立场，擅长匹配合适的资源到合适的人手中，例如敏锐果敢的春宇、黄金搭档晓刚花姐、冷静理性的Patrick、生命教练晶姐等（很遗憾：他们全部来自于清北）。这是一个意料之外但又情理之中的结果：来自最精英院校的毕业生在底层自洽的基础上可以不断迭代信心飞轮，当你见到他们的时刻也许他们已经不再标榜自己的背景，因为那些已经融入到他们身体里的一部分。（与之对照的……）

The other part belongs to the soul-bound linkers. Their auras are often cold and noble. They improve their social bar value in disguise and select matching partners, such as lsynano, yuki, dorothy, liora, bryan, etc. (they Most of them come from some 985 and 211 colleges, including the top2). lsynano is a full-stack algorithm engineer who I think must be given the title of "SOLID". Every technical exchange with him, as long as you are within the scope of his field, you can always get an accurate (with quotes) reply (AI's future). As for dorothyyyyyyyy, you will not be able to get the key to them when you first meet them, but they are like a bottle of fine wine, once opened, it will only make a man's heart deeply soaked in tears.

另一部分属于灵魂绑定的链接者，他们的气场往往高冷且高贵，他们通过变相提高自己社交的bar值，筛选出匹配的合作伙伴，例如lsynano、yuki、dorothy、liora、bryan等（他们大多来自于一些985、211院校，含清北）。lsynano是我认为必须给到「SOLID」称号的全栈算法工程师，与他的每一次技术交流，只要在他的领域打击范围之内，你总能得到精准（带有引用）的回复（AI的未来大抵如此）。而dorothy之类，初识你将完全无法get到它们的钥匙，但它们如一瓶上好的葡萄酒，一旦打开，只会让一颗男人的心被眼泪深深浸泡。

In addition to the above, there are many more, which cannot be mentioned one by one. In our life, we will meet 8,263,563 people, greet with 39,778 ones, become familiar with 3,619 ones, and get close to 275 ones. No matter what our ending is, the only thing we can do is: cherish everyone in front of you.

除了这些，还有很多，无法一一而足，我们的一生会遇到8263563人，会和39778人打招呼，会和3619人熟悉，会和275人亲近，无论我们的终局如何，我们唯一能做的就是：珍惜眼前的每一个人。

Because you are the gifts from God.

因为，你们都是神明的赐赠。
