# Model Routing [​](#model-routing)

Model routing is an intelligent feature of ZenMux that helps you automatically select the most suitable model from a wide range of large language models. The system intelligently balances performance and cost based on the request content, task characteristics, and your preference settings.

Intelligent model selection

No need to manually compare model performance and pricing—ZenMux automatically matches the most suitable model for each request, so you can focus on building your business logic.

## Why Model Routing [​](#why-model-routing)

In real-world applications, different tasks have different model requirements:

-   Simple conversations: using a high-performance model may be wasteful
-   Complex reasoning: a budget model may not meet quality requirements
-   Production environments: you must balance quality, cost, and speed
-   Model selection is hard: dozens of models on the market make manual selection time-consuming

Model routing solves these problems with automated decisions, intelligently matching the optimal model for each request.

## Model List [​](#model-list)

Quick lookup

On the [Models page](https://zenmux.ai/models) you can view all supported models and their basic information. Use the filters on the left, the search box at the top, and sorting options to quickly locate the model you need. Model cards also provide quick access to supported input/output modalities, input/output pricing, Context, Max Tokens, and other key details.

## Quick Start [​](#quick-start)

### Basic Usage [​](#basic-usage)

Model routing is easy to use—simply set the `model` parameter to `zenmux/auto` and specify the candidate model pool via `model_routing_config`. If you do not specify `model_routing_config.available_models`, the system will use the platform’s full [model pool](https://zenmux.ai/models).

How to get model slugs

Models on the ZenMux platform have unique slugs. You can get a model’s slug from the [Models list page](https://zenmux.ai/models): ![model-slug](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/AQG0SIr/model-slug.png) Or from the [model detail page for a specific model](https://zenmux.ai/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5): ![model-slug](https://cdn.marmot-cloud.com/storage/zenmux/2025/10/21/dWYxJnq/model-slug-3.png)

```

Model actually used

The `model` field in the response returns the model selected by intelligent routing, making it easy to monitor and analyze routing behavior.

## How It Works [​](#how-it-works)

### `zenmux/auto` model [​](#zenmux-auto-model)

`zenmux/auto` is a special model identifier in ZenMux. When you specify this model, the system enables intelligent routing.

Routing decision process:

1.  Request analysis: parse prompt content, context length, task type, and other features
2.  Model evaluation: score each model in the candidate pool
3.  Aggregated decision: balance performance, price, and availability according to the `preference` strategy
4.  Model selection: choose the optimal model and forward the request
5.  Result return: annotate the actual model used in the response

Factors considered in routing decisions

-   Task complexity: simple conversation vs. complex reasoning
-   Context length: short dialogue vs. long document analysis
-   Model performance: accuracy, response speed, creativity
-   Model pricing: input/output token unit price
-   Model availability: real-time load, regional restrictions
-   User preference: performance / balanced / price

## Configuration Parameters [​](#configuration-parameters)

### `model_routing_config` object [​](#model-routing-config-object)

Configure intelligent routing behavior via the `model_routing_config` parameter:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `available_models` | `string[]` | Yes | Candidate model list for routing |
| `preference` | `string` | No | Routing preference strategy, default `balanced` |

### `available_models` - Candidate model pool [​](#available-models-candidate-model-pool)

Specify the list of models that intelligent routing can choose from. We recommend including 3–5 models across different performance and price tiers.

Notes

-   The model list must include at least 2 models
-   Mix models from different price tiers for optimal balance

### `preference` - Routing preference strategy [​](#preference-routing-preference-strategy)

| `performance` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | Critical business, professional content |
| `price` | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High concurrency, cost-sensitive |

## Best Practices [​](#best-practices)

### 1\. Configure the candidate model pool appropriately [​](#_1-configure-the-candidate-model-pool-appropriately)

Follow these principles when choosing candidate models:

Recommended:

-   Include 3–5 models across different tiers
-   Mix flagship, mid-tier, and budget models
-   Consider model strengths (creativity, reasoning, speed, etc.)
-   Ensure all models have the necessary API keys configured

Avoid:

-   Only choosing models from the same tier (loses routing advantages)
-   Including too many models (increases decision complexity)

## FAQ [​](#faq)

### Q: How much latency does intelligent routing add? [​](#q-how-much-latency-does-intelligent-routing-add)

A: Routing decisions typically complete within 50–100 ms, with negligible impact for most applications. The actual request response time mainly depends on the selected model’s processing speed.

### Q: How many models should the candidate pool include? [​](#q-how-many-models-should-the-candidate-pool-include)

A: We recommend 3–5 models. Too few cannot fully leverage routing advantages; too many increase decision complexity with diminishing returns.

### Q: What factors does intelligent routing consider? [​](#q-what-factors-does-intelligent-routing-consider)

A: The routing system considers multiple factors:

-   Prompt content and length
-   Task type (conversation, creation, reasoning, etc.)
-   Model performance metrics (accuracy, speed)
-   Model pricing
-   Current load and availability
-   Your `preference` setting

### Q: Can I view detailed routing decision logs? [​](#q-can-i-view-detailed-routing-decision-logs)

A: The response returns the actual model used (`response.model`). You can also view call logs in the [ZenMux user console](https://zenmux.ai/settings/activity) to see the routing details for each request.

### Q: Can I use model routing and provider routing together? [​](#q-can-i-use-model-routing-and-provider-routing-together)

A: Yes. Model routing chooses the most suitable model, while provider routing chooses the optimal provider for the selected model. Using both together enables end-to-end intelligent optimization. For details, see the [Provider Routing documentation](/guide/advanced/provider-routing.html).
