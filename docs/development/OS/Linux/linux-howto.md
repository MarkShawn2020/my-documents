see: [centos init manual](centos-init-manual.md)

## BEST-PRACTICE: linux connection (`ssh`)

### ssh without password

```sh
# ref: https://superuser.com/a/400720/1365851
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh root@47.113.227.53 -T "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### ssh keep connection alive

the simplest way is to force the client to keep sending [a null] message(packet) to the server, in case that the server closed the connection beyond the time limitation, and what you need to do is just to modify 2 lines in your `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` file.

```sh
sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
```

change into these:

```yaml
HOST: *
	ServerAliveInternal 60
```

finally, maybe you should restart your client. If you use the mac, you can:

```sh
# restart-ssh, reference: https://gist.github.com/influx6/46c39709a67f09908cc7542ca444fca2
sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd
sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd
```

### DEPRECIATED: scp no secret/password

It's easy that if only you generate a `id_rsa.pub` and ` ` to your `~/.ssh/authorization_keys` then things all done.

```sh
# username="xxx"
# server="xxxxx"
# file="id_rsa.pub"

# scp ~/.ssh/$file $username@$server:
# ssh $username@$server
# cat $file >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# rm $file
```

- [command line - How do I change mirrors in Ubuntu Server from regional to main? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/104695/how-do-i-change-mirrors-in-ubuntu-server-from-regional-to-main)

#### resolution 1: manual change from the App of `Softwares & Updates`

#### resolution 2: modify the configuration manually from the terminal

> CONCLUSION

```sh
MIRROR_FROM="us.archive.ubuntu.com"
MIRROR_TO="mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn"
APT_FILE="/etc/apt/sources.list"
sudo sed -i "s|${MIRROR_FROM}|${MIRROR_TO}|g" ${APT_FILE}
```

> DETAIL

There are a few mirror servers can be used in China:

- mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn
- ftp.sjtu.edu.cn
- mirrors.aliyun.com
- mirrors.huaweicloud.com
- mirrors.yun-idc.com
- ...

The format of these mirrors may be as `http://${MIRROR_URL}/ubuntu/`

And the default configuration of ubuntu servers are at `/etc/apt/sources.list`, with a copy of backup at `/etc/apt/sources.list.save`.

Here is what the `save` contents are:

```yaml

### how to configure python environment

1. install the python on the server, the version of which would better correspond with the one of the local in case of unexpected error caused by version difference
2. use `virtualenv` to create an env based on this python version named `venv_py` under this working directory
3. activate this env
4. use `pip` to install the `requirements.txt`
5. run!

```sh
PY_VERSION=python3.9

# install the target python version based on its version number
# if you don't use these two lines, then you would suffer from `wget blablabla...` when you checked what the hell the python repo url is
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install ${PY_VERSION}

# use `virtualenv` to create and activate a new python env fast~
sudo apt install virtualenv
virtualenv -p ${PY_VERSION} venv_py
source venv_py/bin/activate

# install all the requirements
# if you need to dump all the requirements of a python project used, you can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` so that a file named of `requirements.txt` would be generated under the current directory
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run our backend of `fastapi`
python main.py
```

### :white_check_mark: cannot use `sudo apt-get install xxx` to install packages

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get disk-upgrade # it may cost a little of time

### ls and delete files

```sh
ls | grep STR | xargs rm -f
```

WARNING! Since the operation pipeline is silent, [you are likely to remove files that you did not intend to remove](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20858524/delete-a-list-of-files-with-find-and-grep#:~:text=you%20are%20likely%20to%20remove%20files%20that%20you%20did%20not%20intend%20to%20remove).

Hence, you'd better use `ls | grep STR` first to check whether all the files to remove meet your expectation.

### fastest delete file

Don't bother checking if the file exists, just try to remove it.

```sh
rm -f PATH

brew install dialog
# or
rm PATH 2> /dev/null

find . -name 'test'

if [ "$BLEG" != xxx ]; then command; fi

```

```py

### DEPRECIATED: how to show absolute path of file from relative

I cannot use `brew install realpath` like their `apt install realpath`, but I can use `realpath`, which may be pre-built-in.

Plus, later I saw that maybe realpath is a submodule of mac package, which is named as `findutils`.

```sh
realpath FILE
```

### how to copy file into clipboard

core ref: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/15327

#### it's easy to copy a text file

```sh
# copy
pbcopy < FILE

# paste to command line
pbpaste

# paste to a new file
pbpaste > FILE2
```

But attention, the `pbpaste` would cause corruption when deals with binary file.

#### but it cannot be done for a binary file

Since the traditional `command + c | command + v` is just copy the reference of file into clipboard, instead of the content itself, we had no way to use `pbcopy` to copy a file, and then use `command + v` to paste at another place.

A solution is to use osascript.

```osascript
#!/usr/bin/osascript
on run args
  set abs_path to do shell script "/usr/local/bin/greadlink -f -- " & (first item of args)
  set the clipboard to POSIX file abs_path
end
```

- see: [bash - unix diff side-to-side results? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17195308/unix-diff-side-to-side-results)

There is a few of `diff` commands for us to choose.

#### resolution 1: `diff F1 F2`

![picture 9](https://mark-vue-oss.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/linux-hwoto-1642517649112-cb2bf00d7a0d7d954fdc039c3862869a96a67c75fc4190101616cd5b3ad0495a.png)

#### resolution 2: `diff -y F1 F2` or `sdiff F1 F2`

![picture 10](https://mark-vue-oss.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/linux-hwoto-1642517708938-fd8d1056dcc311fca0ff60316445a2fea77f670b4d7353cea9d6034775beb75a.png)

#### resolution 3: `vimdiff F1 F2`

It's awesome! Isn't it?

![picture 12](https://mark-vue-oss.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/linux-hwoto-1642517738027-4beec462aa9bda3ff2127c563de64a20d8703edc7774603372fce03807992a96.png)

#### TODO: resolution 4: git diff

### FIXME: how to copy/move directory files correctly to soft links under target directory without affecting git?

example:

When I zipped one modified `frameworks/native` directory to be e.g. `RAW`, and then reset the `frameworks/native` to be the init.

Then I move all the files under `RAW` to `frameworks/native` with the command:

```sh
cp -r RAW/* TARGET/frameworks/native/
```

The error arose up since there are soft links under `frameworks/native`, such as `libs/ui` which is indeed `libs/ui -> XXX/ui`.

However, in my zipped file of `RAW`, the links seemingly have turned to be the real files/dirs, which introduced the problem `directory --> non-directory`.

The wanted effect is copying/moving all the files under conflicted directory to where they should be.

However, the git marked those files as `TypeChange`...

### list all the shells

```sh
$ cat /etc/shells # list valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/bin/zsh
/usr/bin/zsh
```

### background: `sh` is different with `bash`

When I write `source` in shell script, and run by `sh xx.sh`, then it failed with `no permission`.

However, when I use `bash xx.sh`, then everything runs well.

Thus, the `sh` definitely doesn't equal as `bash`, and it seems that function of `sh` is the subset of `bash`.

If so, why I still need to use `sh`? Just for short?

### switch shell

You can change your default shell using the chsh (“change shell” ) command as follows.

The syntax is:

```sh
# usage
chsh
chsh -s {shell-name-here}
chsh -s {shell-name-here} {user-name-here}

# samples
chsh -s /bin/bash
chsh -s /bin/bash $USER

#### resolution 1. use function: easiest but side effect

```sh
function echo() { /bin/echo $PREFIX$*; }
```

But this would affect the `echo XXX >> FILE`, since we doesn't want to change the content to write into file.

#### RECOMMENDED: resolution 2. redirect stdin/err

```sh
exec > >(trap "" INT TERM; sed 's/^/foo: /')
exec 2> >(trap "" INT TERM; sed 's/^/foo: (stderr) /' >&2)
```

This is my recommended resolution since it only affects the stdin/err.

1. using `find`

```sh
function checkFileSizesOfType() {
    find . -not -path "./.history/*" -not -path "**/node_modules/*" -name "*.$1" -type f -exec ls -al {} \; | sort -k5 -rn | sed 's/ \+/\t/g' | cut -f 9
}
```

### `alias` vs `variable`

> `alias` is used for executable command, while variable is a variable, so if we want to use alias as a variable, we should first define a variable of the same name.

#### BEST-PRACTICE: auto-translate

!!!warning Don't use `~` as the user dir, since it can't be auto translated as the sub variable. e.g.

    ```sh
    export a10=~/android
    export n10=$a10/xxx
    ```

    The first `ls $a10`, and enter `TAB` is ok; while the `ls $n10` and enter `TAB` not, since it would translate to be `\~/android` which has an extra `\` before.

#### bugfix: alias in script file can't use in the outer shell

!!!warning We should use `source xx.sh` rather than `sh xx.sh` in order to make variables/aliases work in the outer shell since `sh` would create a sub shell while `source` not.

# when there's only one arg as a variable, it's ok to directly use it, and the following two methods are equal
PACKAGE_TO_INSTALL="vim"
PACKAGE_TO_INSTALL=vim
sudo apt install -y $PACKAGE_TO_INSTALL

# However, if there are multi args as a variable, we need to use [`echo`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30061925/9422455) to escape the 'hidden quotes' if I didn't understand wrongly. And also, the quotes can't be omitted, or use slashes.
PACKAGES_TO_INSTALL="vim git htop zsh terminator"
PACKAGES_TO_INSTALL=vim\ git\ htop\ zsh\ terminator
sudo apt install -y $(echo $INSTALLED_PACKAGES)

# Since the `echo` is not safe, another way is to use [`xargs`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51242645/9422455), which seems more professional
PACKAGES_TO_INSTALL="vim git htop zsh terminator"

### how to set an alias

#### resolution 1: in terminal

> :warning: this solution only works upon the next command, which can work immediately when executed in shell script file

```sh
# don't add any other characters after alias in order to catch bug
alias sed=gsed
```

#### resolution 2: write into `~/.bash_aliases`

```sh
# ~/.bash_aliases
alias update='sudo yum update'
```

> :warning: this solution needs to ensure the `.bash_aliases` enabled in `.bashrc`

#### :sparkles: using `grep`

e.g. if we want to match '-gen-index' as a pattern.

The `==` resolution may be as easy as: `[ $0 == -gen-index ]`

However, in `grep`, things came a little tricky.

```sh
# resolution 1. using regex with escape
grep '\-gen-index' <<< '-gen-index-xxx'

# resolution 2. using fixed string with forcing recognizing the following string as a pattern
grep -F -e '-gen-index' <<< '-gen-index-xxx'

# if we missed the `-e`, then it would cause error, since it supposes the `-g...` is args
```

### FIXME: check proxy

In [Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/), it introduced two methods to see what/which proxies are we using:

```sh
## approach 1
echo $http_proxy

## approach 2
env | grep -i proxy
```

However, when I configured the proxies in `Manual Proxy`, I am surprised to find nothing using either commands in the above, while the ping to `google.com` does work so that I use it as the measure then.

```sh
ping google.com
```

And another wield thing is before the system was restarted, the `env | grep -i proxy` even shows duplicated results and the change in `Manual Proxy` doesn't work, which is quite confusing.

Maybe we can do more tests later.

## BEST-PRACTICE: linux date/time management

### how to change timezone (and time)

#### resolution 1 (conclusion): directly export

```sh
echo "export TZ='Asia/Shanghai'\n" >> ~/.profile

sudo pkill -u $USER --force
```

#### resolution 2 (detail): choose following directions

```sh
# check current time, as well as timezone
date -R

# if the ending is `+0800`, then it's ok, otherwise you need to change (e.g. `-0800`)

# change timezone (just choose as directed)
tzselect

It tells me the last one is because of `adb`, since I do open the `adb` and not responding then.

And I also checked the last few times when `timed out`, but to find they are different.

So I confirmed the timeout error is temporary, since now I am not going to run any `adb`.

I tried to restart again, and the system does well which identified what I think.
