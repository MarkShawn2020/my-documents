## :ballet_box_with_check: TS4023 error of using (Database) name from external module

I am pretty a newbie to typescript so I wonder what does this error mean and how to solve it?

I tried to modify source code of `better-sqlite3`, and it works -- the error goes.

Although both circumstances would have no effect on the codes run, I do wanna run with no compile warning or errors.

And even `// @ts-ignore` can not suppress this...

If the only solution is to modify the source code of `better-sqlite3`, please do it!

And if in case I missed something, or do things not right, please correct me!

Much thanks!

update 2022-01-08: see it from [[@types/better-sqlite3] Can't use `Database` as both constructor and type 路 Issue #52163 路 DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/52163).

This problem is about design collision.

And since I am not using better-sqlite3 now, so I would just let it go.
