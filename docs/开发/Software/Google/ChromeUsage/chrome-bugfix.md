## FIXME: chrome search wizard

When searching `{N`, there is no result.

But when searching `{N;` there is one.

And certainly, there is also other `{N;` not searched.

What the hell behind the search design is.

You see?

Then it's 2 instead of 1 ! <img alt="picture 8" src="https://mark-vue-oss.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/chrome-bugfix-1641492526469-057ac970d3fc1eaef0f25057eb74e058d0f53b0a2f9fab4ec57be723bb73b92f.png" />

It seems it's because of rendering part ?

Maybe not !

Because the words search seems precise!
