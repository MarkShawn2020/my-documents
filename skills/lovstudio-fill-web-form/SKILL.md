# fill-web-form — Fill Web Forms from Local Knowledge Base

Fetch a web form, extract all fields, deep-search the user's local knowledge
base for matching information, and output a ready-to-use markdown document.

## When to Use

- User provides a URL to a web form and wants help filling it
- Conference speaker applications, event registrations, profile forms
- Any scenario where form fields can be answered from existing local materials

## Workflow (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Fetch and extract form fields

Use `WebFetch` to retrieve the form page and extract ALL fields:

```
WebFetch(url, prompt="Extract ALL form fields. For each field list: label,
type (text/textarea/select/radio/checkbox/file), required status, options
if applicable, min length constraints. Return structured list.")
```

If the form has radio/select fields, make a second `WebFetch` call to get
the exact option text for each.

### Step 2: Deep-search local knowledge base

Launch an `Agent` (subagent_type: Explore, thoroughness: very thorough) to
search the user's knowledge base. The agent prompt MUST include:

1. The complete list of form fields from Step 1
2. Instructions to search for:
   - Personal/professional bio and profile files
   - Speaking/conference history
   - Project descriptions and achievements
   - Company/organization info
   - Published articles and their topics
   - Awards, credentials, media mentions
3. Search locations (adapt to user's repo structure):
   - Profile/about files (`**/profile/**`, `**/about/**`, `**/bio/**`)
   - CLAUDE.md files for project context
   - Posts and articles directories
   - Project directories
   - Any `official.md`, `awards.md`, `resume` files
4. Also check user memory (MEMORY.md) for cached info

Run this in parallel with any additional `WebFetch` calls from Step 1.

### Step 3: Map fields to content

For each form field, synthesize the best answer from search results:

| Field Type | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Short text (name, company, city) | Direct extraction from profile |
| Bio/introduction (min chars) | Compose from official bio, expand to meet minimum |
| Long-form (case background, solution) | Synthesize from articles, projects, talks |
| Radio/select | Pick the best-matching option based on profile |
| File upload | Mark as "needs manual upload" with specs |
| Private (phone, email) | Mark as "needs manual input", suggest if found |

### Step 4: Generate output document

Write a markdown document with ALL form fields filled. Format:

```markdown
---
title: "<Form Name> - 填写内容"
status: draft
---

# <Form Name>

> 表单地址：<URL>

---

## 1. <Field Label>

<Filled content or instruction>

---

## 2. <Field Label>

...
```

**Rules:**
- Number every field matching the form order
- For radio/select: prefix chosen option with `**✅ 选择：**`
- For file uploads: use `> ⚠️ 需上传：<specs>`
- For private fields: use `> ⚠️ 需手动填写`（with suggestion if available）
- For textarea fields with min length: ensure content meets or exceeds minimum
- Include a summary table at the end showing field → status (filled/manual)
- **MANDATORY:** Append an "inspected sources" section at the end of the document
  with a tree of all files that were read/searched during knowledge base retrieval:

```markdown
---

## 附录：检索文件路径

```
knowledge-base/
├── profile/
│   └── official.md          ← 个人简介
├── posts/standalone/2025/
│   ├── 07-10-Vol-51...md    ← 演讲经历
│   └── 06-25-comate...md    ← AI工具评测
├── 1-Projects/lovpen/
│   └── ...                  ← 产品信息
└── CLAUDE.md                ← 项目上下文
```
```

  This tree helps the user verify source coverage and spot missing materials.

**Output naming:** Follow user's naming convention. Default:
`手工川-<form-topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-v0.1.md`

### Step 5: Present summary

After writing the file, show:
1. A summary table of all fields with fill status
2. Count of auto-filled vs needs-manual fields
3. Remind user which fields need manual action (uploads, private data)
4. **The inspected files tree** (same as in the document appendix, for quick review)

## Key Principles

1. **Pre-fill aggressively** — search deeply, compose content, don't leave blanks
2. **Meet all constraints** — character minimums, bullet point counts, etc.
3. **Match form tone** — conference apps need professional language, registrations can be brief
4. **Respect privacy** — never guess phone numbers or passwords, mark for manual input
5. **Cite sources** — when composing from knowledge base, the content should be accurate to the user's real experience
